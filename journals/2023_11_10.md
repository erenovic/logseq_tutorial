# Onboarding session
	- `logseq` = "Log sequence" ( *log-seek* )
	- ## A networked outliner
	  collapsed:: true
		- Built on top of **graph database**
		- Stores all your data in individual **blocks (bullets)** and keeps in plain-text **Markdown** files
		- Structures your thoughts in a **tree-like** structure
		  collapsed:: true
			- Individual blocks = **leaves**
			- Collection of blocks = **branches**
			- Structure is not in the form of folders, but in the form of branches!
		- ### Fundamentals of Logseq
		  collapsed:: true
			- #### Indentation
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			  collapsed:: true
				- Parent
				  collapsed:: true
					- Child
					- Parent and a child
					  collapsed:: true
						- Child
			- #### Expand and collapse
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			  collapsed:: true
				- Click on the arrow next to the block if there is a child of the block
			- #### Focus/zoom
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			  collapsed:: true
				- Clicking into a block, you can focus/zoom
			- #### Sidebar
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			  collapsed:: true
				- Hold shift key and click on the block!
				- Then you can draft a block from one parent to another.
			- #### Quick entry
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			  collapsed:: true
				- Thanks to the indenting and grouping of nodes, you don't need a folder structure
				- **Journals** page allow you to quick enter
				  collapsed:: true
					- You can write everything on your **Journal page**
					- It gives a nice structure with the date of entries
					- Plus, you still benefit from tree-like structure
	- ## Networked Thinking
	  collapsed:: true
		- ![Crazy guy with a network](https://static.tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pub/images/6db_3.jpg){:height 308, :width 442}
		- If you add an image from your local:
		- (Just drag the image here, it will be copied into an assets folder in your repo)
		- Connect things with each other
		- **"Personal wikipedia"**, links to many other pages
		- Difference from _EverNotes_, _Obsidian_, _Notion_: It is a graph database
		  collapsed:: true
			- Your blocks have a place, either on **Journal page**, or another page.
			- Relationship matters, not place: Place is not so important in `logseq`
			  collapsed:: true
				- We can off-load some stress from our brain by keeping the relation here
				  collapsed:: true
					- 1 idea per block
- # Technicals
	- Security is super important for `logseq` people, everything works local: Nothing is saved on cloud
	- Changing the date format: _Settings_ > _Editor_ > _Date format_
	- Whenever you change entire database > Reindex (click name of graph database on left top)
	- You can check shortcuts through the question mark at right bottom
	- ## Fundamentals
		- ### Journals Page
			- Main entry point for information
			- Then reduce cognitive load by
				- Using pages for distilling/grouping related information
					- Enter all information to journal
					- Then add a link to project page
				- **No need to think where to put new information**
				- Automatically **date-stamping** your notes
		- ### Blocks
			- **Smallest unit of knowledge** is the *block* (like pages in other apps)
			- *Blocks* can be **combined into branches or pages** (like folders in other apps)
		- ### Links!
			- #### Page Links
				- [[brackets]] and #tags
					- [[link with space]] against #link with space
					- Functionality is same, only cosmetic difference
					  id:: 654e5493-fc0f-4a21-a207-0c4c8e2901e3
					- There is also a plug-in letting you search for tags
				- Every link creates **two links**: one *to* destination, one *from* destination (shown in *Linked References*)
				  id:: 654e5493-da7f-483d-aef2-30cdc3600313
					- Prevents duplication and copy/pasting
			- #### Block references
			  id:: 654e5493-063a-4679-8b0d-37e6f5b3fb92
				- You can use right click and copy reference
					- ((654e5493-da7f-483d-aef2-30cdc3600313))
				- Or use double parantheses and type message
					- ((654e5493-da7f-483d-aef2-30cdc3600313))
			- #### Embeds
				- Two types:
					- Either embed a *block*: As if there is a window, preventing duplication
						- Right click and choose 'Copy block embed'
							- {{embed ((654e5493-da7f-483d-aef2-30cdc3600313))}}
						- Or use double curly brackets + embed magic word
							- {{embed ((654e5493-da7f-483d-aef2-30cdc3600313))}}
					- Or embed a *page*: More like a portal
						- You can create a dashboard using page embeds
						- {{embed [[Contents]]}}
				- Do not try embedding a parent block into a child block :)
		- ### Tasks
			- You can create a task using (Cmd/Control + Enter)
				- LATER This is my task
